I got my Mother's both eyes
Cataract ops done at Bannerghatta
branch by Dr. Ravi in June 2022. It
was a successful Ops and she is is
doing fine now.

First the diagnosis happened at
Padmanabha Nagar by Dr. Neelima
Shah. Since my Mother needs a
wheel-chair and she had high BP
and diabetic, it was recommended
to get Ops done at Bannerghatta
branch. The whole coordination
was done by Brinda Mam at
Padmanabha Nagar branch. First
the doctors team helped in
controlling diabetes and BP in 2
weeks before they undertook
surgery.

Overall the experience delivered by
teams at Padmanabha Nagar and
Bannerghatta branches were
excellent and seamless. I can
recommend anyone to reach out to
these branches for eye care.

I had a eye check-up, the staff was
very professional and doctors made
sure the power was identified
accurately and addressed and also
advised how to take care in the
future, I'm completely satisfied with
the results. Mr. Ravi Kumar was
very helpful he assisted and made
sure I pick the right spectacles for
my usage considering that I spend
most of my time in front of a screen.
I've been using it for a week and I'm
completely satisfied with the frame
and lens suggested by him. I am
very satisfied with their services and
would highly recommend if you're
planning to get your eyes checked
out for any issues.

Eye Hospital
First time visited the eye hospital.
The infrastructure, technical
machines were great. Dr. Archana
was convincing. But the technicians
who will check pressure and the
power were not satisfactory.
Consultation fee is 300rs as
introductory offer it is 150rs.

Dr. Rekha of Shares Eye Hospital is
very cordial and friendly. We liked
this place.
Also Ravikumar in lens centre is
very demonstrative and explained
us in detail. Rates looked
competitive.

I went through Lasik Smile .
Surgery Done by Dr Supriya
Bhagath. My over all experience
was good . Response of pharmacy ,

process of smile took 10 minutes
and Dr Supriya performed the
procedure very well, I’m very
thankful and happy about the

Pleasant SMILE experience in
Dr.Agarwal Hospital

It all started with my wife struggled
with the high power specs (-7
diopter) for many years that got
worsened with my one-year-old
daughter, who used to throw it out
multiple times. When I did a Google
search about eye power correction
procedures, I found Dr.Agarwal
Hospital Padmanabh Nagar is
offering SMILE surgery, and I
immediately posted an inquiry.

I got a quick response from the
counselor Suma who guided us
through the entire process well right
from initial tests till the discharge.
Initial tests were done on the same
day, and the Retinal scan, along
with the consultation with surgeon
Dr.Sanjana, was done within three
days. With the confidence built after
witnessing the safety measures
taken in the hospital during the
COVID time, we took an
appointment for the SMILE
procedure and got it done in a
week.

The entire process was hassle-free
with the counselors Suma and
Ganesh took good care of the
admission and paperwork process.
We felt we were in with safe hands
when Dr.Sanjana explained the
procedure, and we were fascinated
by the simplicity of the SMILE
procedure, which took hardly 15
minutes to get it done.

My wife was able to read 6/4
characters the very next day itself,
and she felt only very minor
discomforts on the first day that was
explained already and expected.
We felt really good and happy that
we took the right decision to go for
the SMILE procedure in Dr.Agarwal
Eye Hospital.

Overall the service of the hospital
staff and the experience of
undergoing the SMILE procedure in
Dr.Agarwal Eye Hospital was
fantastic!

I'd suggest anyone who is confused
about if it's good to undergo SMILE
procedure and that too in COVID
times, please go for it without
second thoughts.
Hospital staff is helpful and
knowledgeable. Consulted Dr.
Neelima Shah for my father and
had a good experience. Mr.
Ravikumar was kind enough to
suggest the appropriate spectacles
and got good service. Surely
recommendable.
Good staff and best doctors and
best hospital
Good response by the
management starting from front
office to doctors and etc.
I visited this hospital for my dad's
Cataract operation. Counselor Mrs.
Brinda helped us a lot through out
the procedure. All the doctors and
staff were kind enough to help us
with all our queries.
I had a great experience.
Very good staff
Experienced docotors
Maintaining covid precautions
The service was great, staff was
friendly, glases came on time as
well.
Optician Ravi Kumar really helped
with picking the right lenses based
on my requirements :)

4 star is due to small facility
otherwise it is 5 star.
During June first week took my
mother for eye checkup. Doctors
diagnosed with cataract in both
eyes. As usual hospital suggested
for surgery with clear details about
the procedure and types of lenses.
Took a weeks time and decided to
go for it.
The pre surgery, surgery and post
surgery every thing went smoothly
and at mentioned time. No hassle.
Doctors and supporting staff are
good. Took care of things well.
Post surgery followup checks were
also done timely and precisely..
Now my mother is quite happy with
her vision now. Over all good
experience with the hospital.

Only thing can be bit inconvenient
for people specially old patients is,
the facility is small and without a lift,
OT being in first floor can be
inconvenient.

It was a good experience nice

especially miss thriveni has handled
very enthusiastically.

Excellent service. Very friendly staff
and doctors particularly Mr.
Pradeep who is a counselor @
Padmanabhanagar branch and Dr.
Ravi who did the operation for
Cataract. These two gentlemen and
also Ms. Shanthi at Bannerghatta
branch made the entire process so
easy. Many thanks to these 3 as
also the entire staff of Dr. Agarwals
Eye Hospital.


I recently underwent SMILE
refractive surgery at Agarwals
hospital. Mr. Pradeep helped me
with all the formalities right from
consultation to insurance approval.
Finally my surgery was fixed with
Doctor Sanjana at indiranagar
branch. In this pandemic, all the
safety measures were taken care.
The surgery lasted for about 5mins.
I have finally regained my power
back to normal. Im very happy with
their service. Finally got rid of
contact lenses and spectacles!

I would like to thank Mr. Pradeep
and Dr Sanjana.
It's my pleasure posting this review
for Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital. I
visited this hospital
for my Mother's cataract surgery.
I am immensely happy and satisfied
with the service and hospitality by
all the staff and doctors.

Mr. Pradeep and Ganesh who
councelled very well, guided and
took care of all the paperwork,
helped a lot to ease my work.

Thanks to Dr. Ravi who operated
the cataract with his tremendous
experience
Many thanks to Dr. HimaBindu, Dr.
Sravani and Dr. Neelima who did
checks patiently.

I thank each and every doctor and
medical staff who thoroughly
examined with patience.

I prefer Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital
and suggest my near and dear ones
as well.


They are providing good service
and have well behaved and friendly
staff and the doctors good in co-
ordination with the patients,but
prices of the frames and lenses are
bit high compare to the other optical
shops but the service is really good
and fast!!!


All the staff are co operative and
treated nicely...beyond expectation.
It took 1hour 15 minutes for check
up and procedures. I might have
waited just 5 minutes. Doctor
explained the present position and
adviced me the care to be taken in
a understandable way.

During this Covid times , hospital
had all precautions, the Spectacles
section Mr. Ravi was very helpful in
expelling the kind of lenses and
purpose and usage of it. Promptly
delivered before the scheduled date
.

I went for my mother cataract
surgery in this place. They treated
us very well and they have good
bunch of team which takes care of
your problem so easily. I am very
happy with the kind of service they
provided to me.

It’s very good service hospital staff
all are good
Dr.shavani and Ravikumar was
kind enough to suggest the
appropriate spectacle and got good
service thank you so much

Had visited Agarwal eye hospital for
testing, very good service. Thanks
to Dr.Shravani for proper analysis
and recommendations. Thanks to
Ravi for recommending best glass -
Zylus Pro.
Hai i'm samraj from Bangalore last
weekI visited Today To Dr
Agarwal's Eye Hospital
Padmanabhanagar
Really it was a wonderful
experience. Doctors treated me
well. The ultimate experience staff
who took care of my grandparents
and me Mr.guru is friendly. Triveni
was taking care of patients and
Pharmacist Madhan explained to
them very well how to use the
medicines. Y optician was very rude
to patient change him Immediately
so i didn't take my grandparents to
optical Because of his Behaviour i
Felt Very Bad and security to
Security so i don't know his name
but i request Dr.Agarwal to change
Both of them. Other than this we
had an Awesome Experience.
One-stop shop for all eye-related
care. Hassle free service. Very
friendly and experience front office

I brought my wife for pterygium
surgery. Dr.Sanjana madam
operated it.my wife and myself is
very happy with surgery .
Mr.Pradeep helped me for insurace
cashless procedure. Dr.Nelima
checked the follow up test. I will
refer all my frindes and colloeage .
Thank all the team for awesome
service.


I visited the clinic for consultation
with prior appointment on 05 Nov
2020.I had pleasant experience.
Everything is well
systamized.Partcularly, the front
office staff Shri Guru and Ms Triveni
were courteous ,prompt,
knowledgable and helpful. Ms
Anusri who did the preliminary tests
was very cordial and did the tests
with alacrity and efficiently..Dr
Shailashree was very cordial and
very helpful. Overall it was was
pleasant experience despite the
difficulties imposed on everyone by
Covid19.
I recently got cataract surgery done
for my mother at Dr. Agarwal Eye
Hospital. I did not wanted to
compromise on quality service and
hygiene place to get her operated.
During this pandemic situation, I
was bit worried . But then, all my
worries were put to rest by Mrs.
Suma, Mr. Dhananjay and Dr.
Neelima who counselled us in
going ahead with the surgery. They
were too good in suggesting right
lens to be implanted and even
about the insurance process which
was completely taken care by them
without any hassles.
Words fall short to describe Dr. Ravi
(Medical Director ). I can’t thank
him enough for performing the
surgery with such ease and care. A
very polite and at the same time
truly professional in his approach
towards handling patients. Very
efficient doctor must say. My
sincere heartfelt thanks to him and
the medical staff.
I totally recommend this
hospital.The hospital is very clean
and hygiene with all necessary
protocols followed during this
pandemic situation. Overall very
happy with their hospitality and
service.

I am very happy with the care and
treatment at Dr. Agarwals Eye
Hospital. Their team, right from the
administrator, doctor, pharmacist
and the coordinators are very kind
and have a pleasant approach
towards patients and ensure
seamless service ensuring
comfortable experience for the
patient. Especially, would like to
Thank Suma for her warm
approach and kind coordination.
Very good staff like Mrs Brinda who
helped us get my father eye
cataract operation, Thankfully to Dr
Nileema and Dr Ravi. Keep doing
the best God bless all.

service to all staff and doctors

Had an hygiene experience done in
this hospital in this covid situation
also....underwent surgery cataract
past 2 weeks ago & I hesitated to
use glass. After the cataract which
the lenses suggested by the Dr it's
so comfortable. Past 8 years I was
used by glasses & I felt happy
about the painless surgery which
underwent......good job Dr agarwals


Last time the consultation charge
was 300 and at pandemic situations
how can the organisation charge
too much of consultation and the
consultation charge is 500.and it is
too much for eye hospitals if the
patients visits for repeted problem
at about their situatation.Please
think about patients and not about
mone.
Service is good hospital is clean
and neat Dr sravani guided very
nice going well visiting back is
comfortable

RECOMMENDED IF YOU LIKE TO
BE ROBBED.


Went 2 days ago
The staff is very polite and doctor
was very sweet.
They treat their patients like family!!
HI yesterday i went to Dr.Agarwals
Eye Hospital Padmanabha Nagar
Bangalore for just check-up they
test my eyes and then put drops
after 1hours they told me read and
Dr. XXX Told that you have contract
so we have to operate immediately
ok and go to our consoling he will
explain afterwards Then i came
back to home and next Day i visited
one more hospital SHARADDHA
EYE CARE TRUST Padmanabha
Nagar Bangalore They also tested
twice and put the drops they told
that come next day because u cant
read now .So visited next after
through checking they given lens
prescription So friend my request to
every body Don’t stick with one
doctor take two or three opinions
other wise you will be BAKRA

My mother gone through the
cataract surgery.. it's a very good
hospital for any eye issues.
Excellent staffing and hospitality..I
would like to thank Dr Ravi, Dr
Nilema and Dr Sravani for taking
care of my mother and also brunda,
Suma and Ganesh for the
wonderful support and guidance
Took my mother for checkup. They
decided very quickly that Cataract
operation has to be done
immediately. But no clarity was
given, about the level of
improvement in vision. There was
no surety and confidence within
themselves. To narrate the fact, I
had gone there for a second opinion
after referring to one another
reputed eye hospital. In the
previous hospital, I was told that
"Cataract Surgery is not critical and
can be postponed by a Year. "
The counselor is only focused on
commercials. Unlike other eye
hospitals, she does not have
knowledge of Lenses and the
differences. She was interested to
know whether the patient was
insured. The costs of tests before
and after, the medication cost after
the surgery. I was expecting that
the counselor would explain the
various types of lenses, the
differences in those lenses, the
quality of lenses, which lens to be
preferred for what type of vision.
These could be value add for a
customer visiting a specialized
hospital and most importantly these
do not come at any ADDITIONAL
CONSULTANCY OR
COUNSELING COST. These are
expected to be some basic
suggestions / inputs during the
counseling session. All the staff
was just busy with Watsapp and
their personal mobile phones.
Doctors busy watching News on
mobile - by grace of JIO Unlimited
Free Internet.
I was highly disappointed with the
environment over there.
TOTALLY COMMERCIAL PLACE !
We received the right diagnosis and
treatment without hyping up the
issue. They didn’t force us on
anything either.


Such a hospital i have never seen i
had bought my Dhadi hospital staffs
are following all the protocol rules of
Government And very safe to enter
the hospital due to covid19 Well
sanitized after every patient
checkup. Neet and cleen Hospital
Thanks for all the Doctors and
staffs over there...Safe to visit the
hospital for Eye checkup.

got very good experience by doctor
and all the staff. Than you all the
staff for the very good treatment . I
will suggest you should visit there
for eye related issue.



Hi Friends,
Yesterday I had been to this branch
for a general test, the service was
very bad with reception and with the
doctor who tested my eyes. They
don't even provide a proper
solutions to the eyes problem. In
general after any test it's their
responsibility to provide a report
about the check up like: vision
power, any abnormal causes and
symptoms of eyes problem but here
they are not following. After check
up they simply write some drops
and ask the patient to collect in
pharmacy without explaining on
usage of drops.

I would suggest there are many
reputed eye hospitals in Bangalore
South who provides better service
for the same price what here they
charge. Please don't waste your
valuable time, health and money.
My father underwent cataract for
both eyes, under CGHS. Complete
process, end to end was smooth.
All medical, paramedical and admin
staff especially Dr.Neeima,
Praseed, Ganesh, behaved
professional. Dr Ravi is an expert
Surgeon.

Monry minded..optical charged
nearly 6k..but thats not upto the
quality ..its not fitting well.
Hi am ASI police I had come hear
for Eye check up and hospital is
good well sanatized friendly
atmosphere good staffs and doctor
overall it's one of the best eye care.
Had to wait 20 minutes to get eye
tested. Ultimately got lenses that
are not of proper power. I am
visiting another optician now to get
the proper power lenses. Rates are
exorbitant. No less than ₹5000 for
one frame with lenses. They
probably pass down cost of building
rent, maintenance etc to customer.
The optician at K.S. Clinic (opposite
to Little Flower School) is more
experienced and provides same
lenses at virtually half the rate. Very
disappointed with this Agarwal eye
hospital. Will not visit again. For the
record, they have not even issued
the eye test result mentioning eye
power, etc. This was only verbally
communicated to me by the guy
who sells the frames.

Their optical service is very bad.
Horrible attitude of staff. Vulger
language. Won't make as per
specification. Had to make multiple
visits to get it right. Never visit
them.
Thanks for the guiding well kiran..
You have very good knowledge
about eye surgeries..
Best place to get consultation and
treatment. Special mention for the
good service from Mr Kiran.
Good hospitality, Care takers, staffs
are very Friendly as well as Doctors
I recommend this hospital with high
rating
It's good service and Ravikumar is
good experienced
Excellent service and all the staffs
and doctor s r so help full and well
sanatized hospital super eye care
Excellent follow up and
treatment.All staff are very vo
operative and pleasing.very good
hospital.my suggestion to have
more models for spectacles
I am Really Happy to say that, I had
been with my daughter for her eye
test for her. I absorbed they did all
the required test.... Later I didn't
understand what made them to tell
that my daughter needs to get a
Scanning of eyes as the inner circle
has some problem, I am really so
happy that they have Either Given
me the information on the Efforts
nor a priscription for Scanning.... As
they wanted me to get it done at
their Clinic withoutonly....But I was
shoked when they gave me a
Medication slip which are available
only at their Clinic "FACTS ARE
THEY GAVE IT WITH OUT ANY
REPORTS AND FACTS" I really
don't understand why this kind of
Clinic is recommended online and
having reasonable review.... I then
got to know that all the Reviews
which are positive are either
Christian and Temilians.... Few only
are shown which have real facts
about the Clinic.... I really was
looking about the People with Min
range income will really be
misguided by the way the Clinic is
showcasing....

Being a Media Person.. I strongly
Recommend take care of yourself
and your family....

Good hospital staff are very
supportive dr sravani treated very

My father was admitted for cataract

cost.Doctors and staff are

operative care was superb.I
suggest Dr Agarwal eye
hospital,Padmanabhanagar,for your
eye problems.I would like to give 5
star rating for their service.
We had nice service from you

Hi..
Its was awesome time, I was very
comfortable with service given by
ravi kumar.. I would like to visit
again for future required to the
same place.. thank u so much
It was good experience..nice
doctors very excellent front office
handled very well
Doctor checked my eyes very well.
Good service.

I had been to Agarwal eye hospital
3 months back with my grand
mother. The infrastructure was
amazing and the staffs were
friendly. The receptionalist (triveni
and chand) took good care of my
grand mother. Now she is going
alone without my help trusting the
Agarwal eye hospital and staffs.
The experience with the eye
hospital was good.. Dr sravani
treated me well and got specs with
Mr Ravi.
Nice service.....the doctor are very
good.....Ravi kumar that guy
services are goood.

Zero organization. They make you
wait for an hour for a 5 minute
consultation. Don't handle queuing
of patients properly. When asked
any question, like asking about
lenses during a check up,
consultants say come back one
month later when your current issue
clears up. Don't have proper
understanding of what patients
want or need to know. Terrible
I came here for eye check and
taken glasses form optical. I got
good support from Mr.Mallikaarjuna
to select the frame. Thanks to all
the staff for good survice.
Very nice experience and staff at
padmanabhanagar branch are very
helpful to do my mother cashless
eye treatment tq

Got my surgery done to get rid of
glasses, very happy with the one on

Worst Hospital Ever. Went for some
normal redness is eye due to heavy
work and stress as I am a software
engineer. Technicians also involved
in high pitching for sales to
purchase expensive medicines
rather than concern for curing.
Doctors all ladies were present, My
pain and swell in eye has got
increased even after medication.
These people concentrate on
business. Better avoid and consult
local other specialists. This
agarwals is really poor.

I had bien to eye checkup for Dr.
Agarwal eye hospital Treatment
Was excellent and it Was refered
by my Relative Mr Manju and
Réception people took care of us it
is truly Wonderful service
Met the best doctor at this hospital
and staff took very good care of me.

Few of my family members recently
diagnosed with cataract surgery in
Agarwal's eye hosportal in

our concerns/queries from start to
the end of the surgery
I had my mom's cataract surgery a
week back .We had a extremely
good experience during the entire

professional and caring. Keep up

Worst treatment by this hospital. My
mother has undergone cataract
surgery for both the eyes. For left
eyes they didn't do the surgery
properly. She couldn't see properly.
They are trying to convince us with
one or other reason. Never
expected this from a Dr agarwal
hospital.

Super service done by Dr.sravani

Had allergy in eye for my niece who
is 2yrs, very friendly staff who made
the little one very comfortable at the
hospital through out the check up in
the hospital. Dr's were friendly too..
One of the worst hospitals i have
ever visited so far... go there if you
want to get rid of your peace of
mind, money and of course your
eyes ..
My daughter aged 14 years started
complaining of regular head ache
and pain in her eyes occasionally.
When she started complaining this
very
frequently, we decided to get it
checked at Agarwals eye hospital
padmanabhanagar, which is just at
a stones throw distance from our
home.
On the day when we went there for
the checkup, they first asked us the
complete history and then told us
that the have to do some tests
which
would take some 2 hours or so.
They put some drops / liquids into
my daughters eyes and we were
told that the tests would be
conducted after some time.

After an hour or so, they did few
tests and the guy who did the tests
started saying that there is
something seriously wrong (he was
not a doctor either). All of us
including my daughter were
shattered by just hearing his
comments even before seeing /
seeking the doctors advice with
those reports.

He gave us few printouts and asked
us to wait for a doctor to see those
reports and suggest us what to be
done next. After 15 mins, a lady
doctor came and after seeing the
reports she said that there is
substantial power in both the eyes
and also that it has all the
symptoms of Glaucoma and she
suggested few more tests to be
done to get it confirmed (not to
mention that those tests costed few
thousands).

Moreover that doctor also
suggested to go immediately for
glasses to my daughter which had
to be bought at their hospital itself.
We were totally shattered and did
not know what to do next.
Somehow we gathered courage
and told her that we would be back
in a day or two.

After consulting few of our relatives
and friends, we decided to go in for
second opinion and got the same
tests done at two more reputed eye
hospitals. To our surprise and
delight, all the test results were
negative and doctors in both the
hospitals told us that there is
absolutely no problem with my
daughters eyes and all that has
happened is
over exertion on the eyes which
would be resolved with few simple
eye exercises.

We were so angry with Agarwals
hospital that we decided to go back
and ask their explanation on this.
When we went there, we just told
them that we are back to meet the
doctor and seek further steps on
this.However the doctor who had
seen my daughter was not there on
that day and we were asked to
meet an other doctor. The other
doctor whom we met that day after
seeing the report said that there
was no need of any glasses,
however those tests as
recommended were very much
necessary.
When we started shouting and
raised our voice saying that how
come the other doctor said a
different story and that we had got
the same checked in 2 more
hospitals and everything was
perfectly fine, she simply said that
she would connect us to the same
doctor who had seen my daughter
and just dialed her number and
gave the phone to us.

I literally shouted on that doctor
over phone and after she heard all
our story so far, the reason she
gave was horrifying. She said that
the drops / medicine they use
before the test are different and
hence the difference in the test
results. She also said that the
Glaucoma test had no relation to
this and when we asked why has
that test been referred to us in that
case, she had no answer and
disconnected the phone
immediately.

My sincere request to all those
reading my lengthy review is to only
make you all aware that this
hospital is just a money making
center and is not fit for anything and
have useless doctors. Please think
twice before you decide to go to this
idiotic hospital.


Worst hospital. You will not find
experienced doctors here. All are
students/practitioners. You need to
visit 3-4 times to hospital get your
spectacles correctly done. It's
simply waste of time/money. All the
tests done here are ordinary when
compared with other good eye
hospitals. Think before visiting here.

I went to eye check for here but
who is tested my eyes he is not
check properly after another
madam testing same she is also not
tested properly may be not qualified
eye testing here .I am able to see
the words properly hear I m dis
satisfied hear

Had a bad experience because the
doctor said your patient do not have
any eye power and no need of
wearing spectacles but I was having
the power of + 1.0 for the right eye
and for the left and the doctor only
prescribed medicine for the proper
closing of the eyelid and had to wait
in long time to get a check
up....doctors was sitting simply and
they wasted my one hour of time in
the name of some drops... And
whoever goes to this Hospital never
visits it again..
